This branch contains a single-page version of the emulator which has been integrated with HTML to "show" the processing.

To Run emulator, download the file "fullEmulator.html" and render it within a web browswer (tested to work with Chrome). Aside from the HTML integration, it contains the same processing logic as the other (Node.js) branch.
